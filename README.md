# Crypto TAX Exporter

> The only things certain in life are death and taxes!

Use this tool to export crypto transactions to a CSV file from your
"self custody" wallets. Then import them into your favourite TAX
reporting tool.

# Contributing & Donations

I encourage the community to take part and contribute new integrations. This is especially true for "low cap" coins that the current TAX calculators are not supporting.

Each contributor will be able to include their own wallet address for donations. This will show for every user that uses the provider.

It's the responsibility of the contributor to maintain their provider in a working state. They are responsible for addressing issues raised against their provider.

I reserve to right to remove the provider or re-allocate the wallet address to someone else that is maintaining the provider if issues are not being addressed.
